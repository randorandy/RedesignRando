WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/RedesignRando/

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Redesign rom in the roms folder - it must be named Redesign.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

Thanks to Komaru for your blessing and Audraxys for the logic groundwork that has already been done:

Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:

GAMEPLAY
This version of Redesign came out of a conversation like, "can we play Redesign with original Super Metroid physics?" The answer was "mostly, yes" and we started down this road. This version of the randomizer is intended for use with the "regular SM" physics but the project is meant to bridge both worlds. For now, use a modified rom with starting walljump. The IPS patch is provided in the repo and there is a link at the top of the web roller to find it.
